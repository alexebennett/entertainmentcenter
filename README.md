# Entertainment Center

Entertainment Center is a simple appication coded with HTML, CSS, and Python, catalouging my favourite films. It uses server side code to store a list of movies, their poster art, and other details, while letting the user view trailers in a pop-up Youtube video. 

## Instalation

1. Clone the Github repository and download to your computer, keeping all three files in the same folder.
2. Launch entertainment_center.py using IDLE and the Python Launcher. 
3. View the rendered html in your browser.
4. Watch trailers
